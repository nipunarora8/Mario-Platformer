# Mario-Platformer
This is a classic and simple mario game. <br>
Play, and enjoy (will add more to this repo in future). <br>
This project is a part of Data Structures in Real Life course by Coding Blocks that is helping me implement the data structures like arrays, stack queue's, dynamic programming etc in real life projects.<br> 
Thank You
